MM-cSNN: Multi-Modular - continuous-time Spike Neural Network

The idea behind cSNN is to stick to the biological evolution of brains. Brains use continuous spike to transfer and treat information and data through neural connection. Neurons are for most binary and only spike to all their output neighbor if some threshold is trespassed in their input neighbor.
